In the project, I created a Java class using an array that calculates the sum of two dices thrown, for n number of games. For example, if two dices 
are thrown a 1000 times, the results should list the sum (from 2 as the lowest sum can be 2[1+1] to 12 as the highest sum can be 12[6+6]) along with 
the number of games, from 1000, in which that sum came.
